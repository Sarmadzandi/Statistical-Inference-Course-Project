# Statistical-Inference-Course-Project

In this project, I studied and analyzed a series of real datasets with what I learned in this course. To begin analyzing a dataset, the first phase is to get familiar with it. In the first phase of the project, this acquaintance was made by observing the features of the dataset and distribution of the values and visualizing the data to make initial guesses about it. In the second phase, by performing statistical tests, I made sure my guesses were correct and made our claims with certainty.
